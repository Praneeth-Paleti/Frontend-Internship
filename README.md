# Frontend-Internship

🚀 Web Development Journey | Frontend-Focused
Welcome to my Frontend Development Journey, where I’m learning to build clean, responsive, and real-world user interfaces — one project at a time.

🧱 Current Focus:
HTML | CSS | Flexbox | Grid | JavaScript (Core)
I’m currently mastering the fundamentals of web layout and interactivity, laying a strong foundation for full-stack MERN development later.

🛠️ My Approach:
🔹 Structured Learning:
Step-by-step progression through frontend technologies, focusing on concept clarity and best practices.

🔹 Project-Based Practice:
Each topic is backed by hands-on mini-projects (like UI clones) that apply real-world design logic.

🔹 Weekly Progress Logs:
I document what I build, what I learn, and how I solve problems — building my skills in public.
